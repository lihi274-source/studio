/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-
 * specific data is stored in a dedicated document within the top-level `/users`
 * collection, and access is restricted to the authenticated owner of that data.
 *
 * Data Structure: All user profile data is organized under the path `/users/{userId}`,
 * where `{userId}` corresponds directly to the Firebase Authentication UID. This
 * creates a simple and secure-by-default structure.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only read or write their own profile document.
 *   They cannot access the data of any other user.
 * - No Public Listing: Listing all documents in the `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent data scraping.
 * - Path-Data Consistency: On creation, the rules enforce that the `id` field
 *   within a user's profile document must match the document's ID (`userId`),
 *   ensuring relational integrity. This `id` field is immutable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The security model relies on path-based
 * authorization (`/users/{userId}`), which is highly performant as it does not
 * require extra document reads (`get()`) to verify permissions.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: This principle is not applicable here as the data model
 * consists of a single collection of private user profiles.
